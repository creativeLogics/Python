    "# Question 1:\n",
    "# Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "# Answer :\n",
    "Object-oriented programming: As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.\n",
    "OOPs Concepts: \n",
    "1) Polymorphism\n",
    "2) Inheritance \n",
    "3) Inheritance\n",
    "4) Ecapsulation\n",
    "5) Abstraction\n",
    "Class Object Method Message Passing."

    "# Question 2:\n",
    "# List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
    "# Answer :\n",
    "\n",
    "1: OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs.\n",
    "2: It is good for defining abstract data types.\n",
    "3: Implementation details are hidden from other modules and other modules has a clearly defined interface.\n",
    "4: It is easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.\n",
    "5: objects, methods, instance, message passing, inheritance are some important properties provided by these particular languages\n",
    "6: encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction are also counts in these fundamentals of programming language.\n",
    "7: It implements real life scenario.\n",
    "8: In OOP, programmer not only defines data types but also deals with operations applied for data structures."

    "# Differentiate between function and method?\n",
    "# Answer:\n",
    " FUNCTION: A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.\n",
    " \n",
    " METHOD: A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:\n",
    " \n",
    "1) A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.\n",
    "2) A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data)."
